## Installation

1. Download the Noteworthy release zip archive (download source pending);
2. Unzip the contents to the location: '<wow_install_directory>\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\'

NOTE: If you are updating to V1.1 (or higher) from an earlier version, please
delete your old Noteworthy folder first (your settings and data will be unaffected).
This is just to clear out some old files that are no longer being used.

If you are interested in local installation for development purposes,
read the next section.

## Development

Noteworthy development is meant to go in cycles. Code is developed in a
separate directory and when needed it is 'deployed' in WoW, tested then
repeat. All scripts packed in the project exist to support this
philosophy.

Noteworthy project file structure:
```
+- .
|- Noteworthy.toc ---> The TOC file
|- NoteworthyBroker.lua ---> Contains LDB code for Noteworthy
|- NoteworthyButton.xml ---> Code for the floating button
|- NoteworthyMain.lua ---> Main library code
|- NoteworthySystem.lua ---> Code for menus, commands and misc
|- NoteworthyTemplates.xml ---> Noteworthy specific reusable XML templates
|- NoteworthyWindows.xml ---> Noteworthy main XML file (main and alert windows)
+- lib
   +- GhostLib
      |- GhostLib.xml ---> Reusable XML templates
      |- GhostLib.lua ---> Code for text editing
```

Noteworthy XML structure leverages heavily on inheritance, and
components are located in multiple files. Here is a diagram of
inheritance trying to explain which component is in which file and 
which component inherits which.

### Tools

There are a couple of helpful things located in the [tools](/tools) directory.

- local_deploy.ps1 - A script that copies all required Noteworthy files
to the WoW installation directory. The root of install directory can be
passed as a script parameter (enclosed in quotes) otherwise the
environment variable *WOWIL* will be used. The variable value should
also be the root of WoW installation directory. The script performs a
clean copy as in it deletes the contents of the destination directory
first.

``` powershell
# in tools directory
> .\local_deploy.ps1 "C:\Games\Wow"
Successfully installed Noteworthy to C:\Games\Wow\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\Noteworthy.

# or with environment variable
> $env:WOWIL = "C:\Games\Wow"
> .\local_deploy.ps1
Successfully installed Noteworthy to C:\Games\Wow\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\Noteworthy.
```

- package.ps1 - Packages the whole project to an archive. Accepts
version parameter that will be appended to the archive name. If no
parameter is passed current timestamp will be appended. Archive
contains a folder called *Noteworthy* with addon files only.

``` powershell
# in tools directory
> .\package.ps1
Created archive 'C:\dev\Noteworthy-2.0\Noteworthy_10012020151502.zip'.

# with version
> .\package.ps1 "2.0-alpha"
Created archive 'C:\dev\Noteworthy-2.0\Noteworthy-v2.0-alpha.zip'.
```

All scripts must be run from the *tools* directory.
